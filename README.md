# Naruto-detection
object dection--my favourite character naruto.

plan of execution 

collect video of naruto and saskue in the fight..
then get the images from the video..
label them..

use tensorflow api to train the object detection model..to detect naruro..

mainly record all the steps..

some steps are missing..fill in..

1. Clone this repository https://github.com/tensorflow/models and put it in a folder named tensorflow1
2. From this repository choose the model you want to run the object dection with and download it and put it in the 
   tensorflow1/../object detection folder
   
3. Clone this https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10 repository and put it in the object detection folder..

object detection folder..everything in

4. Since we are starting from scratch, delete all the files in the training folder, placeholder file in inference_graph folder and all the images in training and test foders including the csv label files.

5. If you are running this in colab notebook, then follow naruto and saskue notebook in gethureddy.
